A Chrome extension.
For Chrome users who separate their tabs into multiple windows based on subject matter. (i.e. a "work" window, a "reddit tabs" window, a "check this stuff out when you take a break" window, etc.)

Allows the user to give each Chrome window a short label.  When a different application (or another Chrome window) is focused, each unfocused window will display the label clearly when previewed from the Windows taskbar.

Unsure how application preview/thumbnails may or may not work on other operating systems.
